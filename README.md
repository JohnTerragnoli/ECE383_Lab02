#LAB02

#Purpose

The purpose of this lab was to create an oscilloscope which would take in an electrical signal through an auxillary port and then output that signal onto a screen as a visual signal. 
This was done with the ATLYS Spartan 6, an FPGA.  

#Approach/Planning

At the beginning of the lab, a large schematic was given with all of the desired pieces of the oscilloscope.  The building process then, was to build this design up piece by piece.
The schematic can be seen below:

In lab 1, the counter and video module, which drew images onto the screen was developed.
